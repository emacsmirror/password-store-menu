* Password-store-menu
**  A more convenient UI for password-store.el

This emacs package improves on the user interface for password-store.el (see https://www.passwordstore.org/), adding a friendly transient pop-up.

Here's what that looks like:

** Features
The package adds a bunch of useful features, including:

- A minor mode for editing/inserting password files
- Changes to password files are auto-committed to git
- Easy browsing and viewing of entries
- Inserting multi-line passwords
- Generating passwords with arguments (e.g. length, no-symbols)
- Showing password QR code inside emacs in text or image format (PNG, SVG)
- Generating QR Codes for fields as well as secrets

** QR Code support
On some systems the command-line utility ~qrencode~ is automatically
installed with ~pass~. If ~qrencode~ is in your path, this will be
detected and used.

If you dont have ~qrencode~ or prefer elisp-native encoding, you can
install [[https://github.com/ruediger/qrencode-el/tree/main][qrencode.el]] instead, and that will be used.

** Setup
This package is available through MELPA. You can use "package-install" to install it.

After installing, make sure to "require" the package and call
"password-store-menu-enable", which will install the keybinding for
password-store-menu, and make sure that your password files will be
opened in a special edit mode.

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'password-store-menu)

  (setopt
   ;; Optionally set a custom key, default is C-c p
   password-store-menu-key  "C-c p"
   ;; Auto commit can be turned off, default is t
   password-store-menu-edit-auto-commit t)

  ;; Binds the key and enables password-store-menu-edit-mode
  (password-store-menu-enable)
#+end_src

** Use-package
With use-package it looks like this:

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package password-store-menu
    :ensure t
    :config (password-store-menu-enable)
    :custom (password-store-menu-key "C-c p"))
#+end_src


** Usage
By default, the password-store popup menu will be bound to the key
=C-c p=. You can configure this (see above).

The following menu items are available:
